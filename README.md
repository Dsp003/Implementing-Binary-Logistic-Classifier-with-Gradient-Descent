# Implementing-Binary-Logistic-Classifier-with-Gradient-Descent
## Understanding to implement binary Logistic Classifier with Gradient Descent using Numpy.

    Logistic Regression is one of the most widely used algorithm in machine learning for classification. In this notebook let us understand how to implement it with numpy. We will also be using pandas and matplotlib for getting a good idea of our dataset.

    Gradient Descent has been used here as a solver, the main job of a solver is to find the minimum of the cost function. The cost function gives us the error value while comparing our predicted value with the actual value. A logarithmic cost function has been used here since we are building a binary classifier whose labels are 0 or 1.
